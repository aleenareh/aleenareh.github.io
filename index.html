<!--here's the about section (just some info about me)-->

        <p>
          I've always been an avid writer, speaker, and learner. I love acting and writing poetry, and hope to pursue
         those passions in some capacity in the future (not as a profession, but as a personal interest).
          I'll be attending my senior year of high school in the fall and will be
          applying to colleges soon after. My focus is to major in computer science!
          I currently work as a blogger for the non-for-profit Metanoia International and as a volunteer tutor for the Islamic Center of Naperville.
          I also participate in the Girls Who Code program, a curriculum-based organization focused on giving teenage girls tools to further their understanding
          of computer science. This website holds many of the projects I worked on while attending the program.

          My favorite film is <i> Inception </i> , but <i> The Dark Knight Rises </i> is a close second! I enjoy reading comics,
            running (at night), and writing poetry. Currently, I am reading the book <i> Behind the Beautiful Forevers </i> by Katherine Boo
            and I can say that it is definitely one of my favorites!

          Recent Projects: Currently, I work as a blogger for
          <a href = "https://metanoiaintl.org" >Metanoia International</a>,
          an organization centered around helping minority students suffering with
          mental illness. Check out the website to see important resources and tips
          for struggling students. Also, here's a   <a href = "https://youtu.be/q_omsX_bj4w" >link</a> to a recent song I made from scatch for a school production.
          I used code to create the song!
